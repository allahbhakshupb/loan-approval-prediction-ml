# loan-approval-prediction-ml
End-to-end machine learning project for predicting loan approval using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Classification models.
# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and employment status.
## Problem Statement
Manual loan approval is time-consuming and prone to human bias. This project uses machine learning models to automate and improve loan approval decisions.
## Dataset
The dataset contains applicant demographic and financial information including:
- Gender
- Married status
- Education
- Applicant income
- Loan amount
- Credit history
- Dependies

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Results
Random Forest achieved the best performance with improved accuracy and balanced precision-recall.

## Conclusion
The model helps banks make faster and data-driven loan approval decisions.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Handling class imbalance
- Deployment using Flask or Streamlit
